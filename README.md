# Simple web server written in Rust

My first Rust program. Just wanted to try it out so didn't bother to connect it to a db for real auth. Also includes a way to write HTML inside Rust. Don't have support for CSS or images yet but might add that later

## Getting started

-   Get the code:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/youknowedo/webserver.git
    ```

-   Run the program:

    ```
    cargo run
    ```

-   Visit `127.0.0.1:7878`
